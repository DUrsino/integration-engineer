# Network Tokens

Learn how to integration Network Tokens with PowerBoard

# What are Network Tokens?

Network tokens are used in online transaction processing and replaces the users card details (FPAN) with a unique identifier which can be used to process payment without exposing the merchant to raw card data. PowerBoard has developed a solution that works with MasterCard and VISA to ensure that card details that are associated with a Network Token are kept up-to-date from the card schemes even when the underlying card information changes. For example, if a customer reports their card as lost, PowerBoard receives this notification from the card scheme and will update the network token directly with the new card details, ensuring the customers payment details are kept up to date.


# Value Proposition

- **Enhanced Security:** Tokens replace sensitive card details, reducing the exposure of actual card information.

- **Increased Consumer Confidence:** Enhanced security measures boost customer trust in the merchantâ€™s payment systems, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Card Lifecycle Management:** Automated issuer updates keep network tokens up to date, reducing friction for customers in subscription and returning customer scenarios.
